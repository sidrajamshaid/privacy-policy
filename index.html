    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: 2026-02-05</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Super Glue Gamez ("we", "our", or "us")
      collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Multi Storey Jeep
      Parking mobile game (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect personal information directly from you. The App does not
      require account creation and does not ask for your name, email, or phone
      number.
    </p>

    <p>
      The App uses third-party advertising services to show ads. These services
      may collect device identifiers, IP address, approximate location (derived
      from IP), and ad interaction data to deliver and measure ads.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses the following third-party services:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob (Google LLC)</li>
      <li>Unity Ads (Unity Technologies)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These providers may collect and process data as described in their own
      privacy policies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Google Privacy Policy:
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </li>
      <li>
        Unity Privacy Policy:
        https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children
      under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us so we
      can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with ad providers as
      required to serve and measure ads.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect information, but no method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the
      updated version with a new effective date.
    </p>
